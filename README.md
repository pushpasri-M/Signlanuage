# Signlanuage
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing-impaired and the general population by developing a real-time sign language recognition system. The system integrates MediaPipe for skeleton keypoint detection, flex sensors, and MPU6050 IMU sensors to accurately capture hand gestures and movements.
